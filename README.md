# Quote-Build
It is a software for the administrative staff of the company OCIRAGA23 SAS who has to prepare material quotes for a construction project manually, and in consequence,  ineffectively. It is called Quote&Build and is a web application that will increase productivity at an administrative level, focusing on the civil works field. Unlike manually quoting each of the elements needed at the time of construction, our product will save time and make project management much simpler and easier.
